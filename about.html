                <p class="about-lead">I design clarity in messy, complex systems.</p>
                
                <p>My work sits at the intersection of UX, research, AI, and service design—usually in environments with large datasets, multiple stakeholders, strict constraints, and high expectations for accuracy.</p>
                
                <p>Over the last 15+ years, I've shaped enterprise platforms, AI-enabled workflows, data-heavy dashboards, multilingual applications, and global nonprofit systems. My background spans fintech (Fiserv, ADP), AI/ML ecosystems (IBM Watson), e-commerce at scale (G2A), global organizations (UNESCO, JNF), and government-adjacent environments. Across all of them, the themes are consistent: make the complex understandable, reduce cognitive load, and build experiences that teams can actually implement and trust.</p>
                
                <p>I'm both strategic and hands-on.</p>
                
                <p>I run research, map workflows, design IA and interaction models, prototype, and work directly with engineering. But I also lead cross-functional alignment, define UX frameworks, shape AI-enhanced processes, and bring structure to chaotic program spaces. I use AI where it makes sense—research synthesis, clustering, content modeling, and decision-support workflows—without sacrificing rigor or qualitative depth.</p>
                
                <p>My approach is grounded in systems thinking: understanding the ecosystem, clarifying constraints, aligning teams, then building simple, scalable patterns that hold up in real operations. I've reduced reporting cycles from days to minutes, automated global support interactions, improved conversion and retention, and helped teams move from ambiguity to actionable direction.</p>
                
                <p>When I take on a project, I focus on clarity, structure, and long-term usability. It's never just screens—it's the data, the workflows, the governance, the operations, and the people who will own it after launch.</p>
                
                <p class="about-closing">If you're building something complex, data-driven, or AI-enabled—and you need someone who can make it usable, understandable, and real—I'm your person.</p>
