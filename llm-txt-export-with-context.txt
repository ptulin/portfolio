=== CONTEXT ===

INTENDED AUDIENCE:
- Primary: AI agents, LLM-based tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) that fetch and summarize portfolio content
- Secondary: Recruiters using AI tools to search and match candidates
- Tertiary: RAG systems and internal tools that need structured portfolio data
- Not intended for: Direct human reading (though readable)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must be machine-readable (plain text, structured format)
- Must include canonical URLs for verification
- Should align with homepage content for consistency
- No marketing fluff - factual, outcome-oriented
- Must be accessible via simple HTTP GET (no auth, no JS)

SOURCE OF TRUTH:
- Current status: DERIVATIVE (summary of homepage + case studies)
- Derived from: index.html homepage content, case study data
- Not currently: Authoritative primary source
- Relationship: Mirrors existing site copy structure

UPDATE EXPECTATIONS:
- llm.txt is ALLOWED to:
  * Introduce stronger positioning language (e.g., "leading" vs "building")
  * Emphasize AI/product leadership over visual design skills
  * Include outcome-oriented phrasing (e.g., "delivered X% improvement")
  * Use senior-level terminology (e.g., "strategic", "enterprise", "scalable")
  * Highlight business impact alongside technical achievements
  * Optimize for AI agent understanding and recruiter matching

- llm.txt should NOT:
  * Contradict homepage/resume facts
  * Include false or unverifiable claims
  * Use overly promotional language
  * Remove existing factual content

- Optimization goals:
  * Clarity for AI agents parsing and summarizing
  * Positioning for senior UX/Product/AI leadership roles
  * Emphasis on strategic impact and business outcomes
  * Better keyword alignment for recruiter AI tools
